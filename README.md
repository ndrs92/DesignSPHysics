# DesignSPHysics developer change notice

Hi there! For now on DesignSPHysics will be developed by another person in the DualSPHyisics team. It was a pleasure to work in this project, and I'll continue giving support to it. However, if you want to stay up-to-date with the project or contribute to it, please do so in the new repo.

This repository is now hosted on [the DualSPHysics official GitHub account](https://github.com/dualsphysics/DesignSPHysics)
